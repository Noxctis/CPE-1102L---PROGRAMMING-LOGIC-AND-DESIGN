# CPE-1102L---PROGRAMMING-LOGIC-AND-DESIGN
This course is designed to provide the beginning programmer with a guide to developing structured program logic. It introduces students to programming concepts such as program structure, variables, decision structures, loops, arrays, methods, and enforces good style and logical thinking.


# Course Outcomes
By the end of the semester, the students should be able to:

**CO1**	Formulate programming logic solution of a problem through flowcharting and/or pseudocode algorithm.

**CO2**	Produce programming logic solution into code using structured programming techniques with proper documentation.

**Alignment to Program Outcomes**

The learning outcomes in this course are introductory to the achievement of:

**[PO B]** Identify, formulate, research literature and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences and engineering sciences.

**[PO C]** Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design systems, components or processes that meet specified needs with appropriate consideration for public health and safety, cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.

**[PO E]** Create, select and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools, including prediction and modeling, to complex engineering problems, with an understanding of the limitations.
